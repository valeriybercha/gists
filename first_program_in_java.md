# Create the first 'Hello, World' program in Java

### Pre-requisites:
- Java should be already installed on your machine. To verify if 'Java JDK' is installed on your computer, simply run the ``` $ java -version ``` command
in 'Command Prompt (cmd)' (for Windows users). The installed Java version and build should be displayed. If not make sure to [install 
'Java Development Kit' first](https://gist.github.com/valeriybercha/5ba0e91c83bf1d1143527d7f29dec30d).

### Creating a 'Hello, World' program in Java

1. Create a project folder on your computer - ``` C:\Java ```.
2. Open the text editor (e.g. 'Notepad++') and create a new file.
3. Type in the file the following code:

```sh
public class helloWorld { 
      
    public static void main (String args[]){
          
        System.out.println("Hello, World! My first program in Java");
    }
}
```

4. Save the file as 'helloWorld.java' ('.java' is the extension for Java files) and save it in the previously created project directory (``` C:\Java ```).
5. Open the 'Command Prompt (cmd)' and type the following command ```$ cd C:\Java ``` to navigate to the project directory where the 'helloWorld.java' was created.
6. Now we'll have to compile the code first. In terminal type the following command - ``` $ "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15.0.1\bin\javac" helloWorld.java ```.
Press 'Enter'. If no error appeared the Java code is compiled correctly. Note that the path for the 'javac' compilator should be placed in 
quotation marks ("") if 'JAVA_HOME' variable is [not set in the 'Environment Variables'](https://gist.github.com/valeriybercha/5ba0e91c83bf1d1143527d7f29dec30d). If 'JAVA_HOME' is set, simply type ``` $ javac helloWorld.java ``` command. The result will be the same.
7. Run the program with the command ``` $ "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-15.0.1\bin\java" helloWorld ```. The message ``` "Hello, World! My first program in Java" ``` should be displayed. Note again that the pass for java execution file should be placed in quotation markas ("") and the file name can be specified without '.java' extension. Alternatively, run If the ``` $ java helloWorld ``` command.

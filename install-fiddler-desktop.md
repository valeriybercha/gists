# Install and setup Fiddler for Windows

Steps to perform:
1. Download and install 'Fiddler' from here - [https://www.telerik.com/fiddler](https://www.telerik.com/fiddler)
2. Open the application. You have to have an account in order to use Fiddler Everywhere. Create an account if you don't have one, or just sign in of you already are registered.
3. The moment you open the application, you will notice an error mark near the 'URL' section. It means Fiddler by default is not capturing the HTTPs traffic.
4. Click on the error mark. A new window will open. Click on 'Trust and Enable HTTPs'.
5. Now click on setting icon in the upper-right corner and make sure that 'Capture HTTPs traffic' checkbox is checked. Click on 'SAVE' and close.
6. Right below the 'Live Traffic' panel click on the 'Decode'. It will turn on in blue.
7. Now Fiddler Everywhere is ready to capture your traffic.
